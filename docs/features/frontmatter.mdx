## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find similar notes">
    Scores all notes with frontmatter by superset matching, links, tags, folder, recency
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract schema">
    Builds list of valid properties from top 5 similar notes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate enhancement">
    Sends note + examples to OpenCode, requests YAML frontmatter
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge carefully">
    Adds new properties, extends arrays, **never overwrites existing values**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & apply">
    Shows diff modal for your approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

1. Open a note
2. Run command: **Apply OpenCode: Enhance note frontmatter**
3. Review diff and apply changes

<Info>
The AI learns from your existing notes - the more consistent your vault's frontmatter, the better the suggestions.
