title: Wiki Link Identification
description: Identify entities that should become wiki links
---

## Features

- Two strategies: **existing notes only** (instant) or **all entities via AI**
- Configurable mode: first mention only or all mentions
- Shows diff preview before applying
- Smart selection: processes selection if present, otherwise full note
- **Safety guaranteed**: only adds `[[` and `]]` brackets, never modifies content

## Usage

1. Open a note (optionally select specific text)
2. Run: **Apply OpenCode: Identify and add wiki links**
3. Review the diff showing proposed wiki links
4. Click on any green line to remove that link
5. Click **Apply changes** to add the wiki links

<Warning>
The "all entities via AI" strategy is slower but finds entities that don't yet have notes in your vault.
</Warning>
